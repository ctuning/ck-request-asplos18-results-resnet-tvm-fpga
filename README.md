# Introduction

This repository contains raw experimental results in [the CK format](https://github.com/ctuning/ck)
for this [image classification workflow](https://github.com/ctuning/ck-request-asplos18-resnet-tvm-fpga)
from the [ReQuEST tournament at ASPLOS'18](http://cknowledge.org/request-cfp-asplos2018.html) 
on reproducible SW/HW co-design of deep learning (speed, accuracy, energy, costs)
